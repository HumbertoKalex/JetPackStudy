## Description
This project contains almost all features from JetPack Components, such as : MVVM, ViewModelScope, ViewModelLifeCycle, Live Data, Koin, Courotines, Room, LifeCycleAware, NavigationGraph, DataBinding, Androidx.

This project also contains many design patterns useful to daily work, such as SafeRequest which encapsulates courotines calls for better management, interface segregation, hierarchy, among others.

Things related to unit tests I will approach on another project.

My objective with this project, is to show some example of how things works together in a real professional environment for people who are new in android development, and share knowledge with the community.
